How did using diff(FC on windows) help to find bugs ?
Line by line comparison
Differences in files highlighted and shown
Time efficient
Reduces Manual work

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

easy access to older versions to undo modifications
incorporate updations more efficiently
resolve bugs and typos efficiently

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,like you do in Git,vs having versions automatically saved,Like Google Docs does?

pros:
flexibility to save versions with respect to number of lines,time,editiond,logical changes.
available to access when offline

cons:
user may forget to frequently save the versions
cannot access when offline

Why do you think some version control systems,like Git,allow saving multiple files in one commit,while others ,like Google docs ,treat each file saparately?

Git takes into the consideration the fact that the files are connected to each other .
change in a file can lead to subsequent changes in other files in the commit.
easy to assess version changes if the files are present in a commit together than treat them differently. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log gives us the details of all the commits made in the repository.
git diff shows the differences (additions and deletions made) between the two commits whose iD is followed after the diff git command.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
we can trace back to the bug easily and fix the breakage.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
To read repositories and learn from them.
Gradually contribute to open source code.
